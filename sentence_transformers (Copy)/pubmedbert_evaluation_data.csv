Internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint: is there still a place for ultrasound?,"A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. Such a case has never been reported. A 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit.","Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients.

Explanation:
The use of intravenous midazolam or propofol is associated with increased risk of hypotension compared with ketamine alone.
Ketamine has been used as a sole agent for procedural sedation since its introduction more than four decades ago. It provides rapid onset of action, amnesia, analgesia, and immobility without significant respiratory depression. Ketamine also increases blood pressure through stimulation of peripheral α-adrenergic receptors; however, this effect may not occur if it is given rapidly via bolus injection rather than infusion. In addition, there have been reports that ketamine can cause bronchospasm, especially among asthmatic individuals. However, these effects appear to be rare and usually mild",yes,Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.,16498158,4.040863990783691,0.0,0.0,4,BERT,768

The authors' aim was to determine the factors affecting the uptake and use of a Web-based protocol system for medical oncology in the Australian setting. The authors conducted 50 interviews and observed medical oncology physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in their treatment setting at 6 hospitals in different geographic locations. The Web-based system plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment across participating sites. However, its use varies according to hospital location, clinician roles, and experience. A range of issues impact on clinicians' attitudes toward and use of the Web-based system. Important factors are clinician-specific (eg, their need for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time) or environmental (eg, hospital policy on protocol use, endorsement of the system, and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, such as sufficient computers). The level of education received regarding the system was also found to be integral to its ongoing use.","Yes
Explanation:
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether coating titanium implants with antimicrobial agents could prevent infection after surgery.
Infection following dental implant placement can lead to failure of osseointegration and loss of the prosthesis. Infections may occur due to contamination from bacteria present in saliva or blood that enters the wound site through microfractures created during drilling. This type of infection occurs most commonly within one week postoperatively but has been reported up until six months later. Other causes include poor oral hygiene practices before surgery; smoking cigarettes which decreases oxygen levels around teeth leading them to become more susceptible to decay; diabetes mellitus because high glucose concentrations promote growth of certain types of bacteria like Streptococcus mutans while low",yes,Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.,24622801,4.157899856567383,0.0,0.0,5,BERT,768

Explanation:
APC gene mutations can cause Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), which is characterized by multiple colorectal polyps starting at early ages. If left untreated, FAP will lead to colon cancer.
The most common treatment for this condition is colectomy or removal of the entire large intestine. However, there have been cases where individuals with FAP underwent genetic testing before surgery and discovered they carried certain types of APC mutations known as ""gatekeeper"" mutations. These gatekeepers prevent other genes from being activated during tumor formation so removing them may not necessarily stop further growth of tumors even after complete resection has occurred through traditional methods such as chemotherapy drugs like fluorouracil/leucovorin combination",maybe,"As age at manifestation and course of the disease may be rather variable, even in carriers of identical germline mutations, therapeutic decisions should be based on colonoscopic findings in individual patients rather than on the site of mutation. However, in patients with mutations within codons 1445-1580, it may be advisable to postpone elective colectomy because desmoids may arise through surgical intervention.",11247896,4.144925355911255,0.0,0.0,8,BERT,768

Explanation:
The question asks whether radiation therapy during pregnancy increases the chance that you will develop breast cancer later.
This review looked at studies done up until March 2010.
We included six studies involving over 300 women exposed to radiation while pregnant. All but one of these studies had been published before 1989 so they did not have access to modern imaging techniques which may make it easier to detect early cancers. We excluded two other studies because we could not get enough details about them to include them in our results.
All of the studies compared women who developed breast cancer after being exposed to radiation during pregnancy against those who didn't receive any exposure. None of the studies directly measured how much radiation each woman actually got; instead they estimated this based",yes,"The results of this study indicate that the risk of breast cancer after RT is greater with irradiation around the time of pregnancy. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Because of the small sample size and limited follow-up, additional studies are recommended to confirm these findings.",15050326,4.0518999099731445,0.0,0.0,17,BERT,768

HIF1A as a major vascular endothelial growth factor regulator: do its polymorphisms have an association with age-related macular degeneration?,": The histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, HINT1, hydrolyzes adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidate substrates such as AMP-morpholidate. The human HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia. HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. It was also found to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. : In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls).

Explanation:
The study shows that obese mice had elevated serum concentrations of leptin compared to lean control animals. Leptin has been implicated in many metabolic processes including appetite regulation, energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, bone formation, angiogenesis, fertility, reproduction, hematopoiesis, wound healing, immunity, neuroendocrine function, learning and memory.
Leptin also plays a role in regulating oxidative stress through its effects on reactive oxygen species production via activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases. This suggests that leptin might contribute towards development of systemic low-grade inflammation seen in obesity which can lead to various diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus",yes,These findings show that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.,20577124,4.098154067993164,0.0,0.0,38,BERT,768

Explanation:
Solitary kidneys have been reported to be less susceptible than paired kidneys to acute renal failure after prolonged warm ischemic injury [1]. This observation has led some investigators to suggest that unilateral nephrectomy may not increase susceptibility to postoperative acute tubular necrosis following cardiac surgery.
The study by Koo et al., however, does not support this hypothesis. In fact, they demonstrate that there is no difference in serum creatinine levels among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with either one or two native kidneys. Furthermore, these data do not indicate whether any differences exist in the incidence of dialysis requirement or mortality rates between groups. Therefore, it remains unclear if solitary kidneys are truly protected from ischemic damage compared with those present bil",yes,"Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.",23517744,4.048349857330322,0.0,0.0,52,BERT,768

Explanation:
The article ""Withholding or Withdrawing Life-Sustaining Treatment from Critically Ill Children"" published in JAMA Pediatrics provides valuable insights into this complex ethical dilemma faced by healthcare professionals.
Firstly, it highlights that there may not always be consensus among parents, caregivers, and health providers regarding decisions related to life-sustaining interventions. This suggests that open communication channels must exist within these relationships so everyone involved can express their concerns effectively while respecting each other’s perspectives.
Secondly, although some studies suggest that most families agree with limiting aggressive therapies once they understand all available options clearly; however, others indicate significant disagreement amongst them even after receiving adequate explanations about potential benefits versus risks associated with specific treatments. Therefore, ensuring comprehensive disclosure remains crucial",yes,"GFRUPs procedure was applicable in most cases.

Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques?,"This study aims to evaluate local failure patterns in node negative breast cancer patients treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy including internal mammary chain only. Retrospective analysis of 92 internal or central-breast node-negative tumours with mastectomy and external irradiation of the internal mammary chain at the dose of 50 Gy, from 1994 to 1998.

Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the median scleral dose 546 Gy. After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% (3 patients alive with metastasis).

Explanation:
The question asks if increasing the apical dose changes outcomes for radiation treatments using Ruthenium-106.
In this case, we are looking at two different studies that use Ruthenium-106 as their source of radiation. In one study, they used it to treat eye cancers while another uses it to treat breast cancer. Both studies look into how much radiation should be given during each session but neither looks specifically at whether changing the amount will affect the patient's health negatively or positively. However, since these types of questions can't really be answered through scientific methods like experiments because you'd need too many people involved who would all get sick from getting exposed to high doses over time which isn't feasible due to ethical reasons; therefore I",no,Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose.

The authors conducted 50 interviews and observed medical oncology physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in their treatment setting at 6 hospitals in different geographic locations. The Web-based system plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment across participating sites. However, its use varies according to hospital location, clinician roles, and experience. A range of issues impact on clinicians' attitudes toward and use of the Web-based system. Important factors are clinician-specific (eg, their need for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time) or environmental (eg, hospital policy on protocol use, endorsement of the system, and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, such as sufficient computers).

Explanation:
The purpose of this article is to describe how patients from diverse backgrounds may differ in their understanding of what constitutes effective communication during encounters with providers.
This paper describes the results of a qualitative analysis of focus groups held among African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, and Caucasian adults living in Hawaii. Participants were asked open-ended questions related to their experiences communicating with healthcare professionals. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory methods.

Explanation:
Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. The incidence has been increasing over recent decades; however, it remains unclear whether this increase reflects improved detection rates rather than true increases in disease prevalence.
The majority of colorectal carcinomas arise as a result of progression through multiple stages of dysplasia within pre-existing polyps. Adenomatous polyp formation occurs throughout life but becomes more prevalent after the fourth decade. It is estimated that approximately half of all individuals will develop colonic adenoma(s), although not necessarily clinically significant ones.
